# 特征选择案例分析：预测阿尔茨海默病

## 背景介绍

目前有一些biomarkers用来诊断阿尔茨海默病，我们想要实现的是根据这些biomarkers的数据来对早期患者与正常人分类，预测病人是否患有阿尔茨海默病。



Data included:

- Demographic characteristics such as age and gender
- Apolipoprotein E genotype
- Protein measurements of Aβ, Tau, and a phosphorylated version of Tau (called pTau)
- Protein measurements of 124 exploratory biomarkers
- Clinical dementia scores

**The goal of this analysis is to create classification models using the demographic and assay data to predict which patients have early stages of disease.**
